# BeatBloom PWA Setup Guide

## 🎯 What You Need to Do

### 1. Install Dependencies

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -D vite-plugin-pwa
```

### 2. Create PWA Icons

You need to create two icon files in the `public/logo/` directory:

- **icon-192.png** (192x192 pixels)
- **icon-512.png** (512x512 pixels)

**Icon Requirements:**

- Use your BeatBloom logo
- Square format (192x192 and 512x512)
- PNG format
- Clear, recognizable design
- Works well on light and dark backgrounds

**Quick Way to Generate:**

1. Use your existing `favicon.png` as a base
2. Resize it to 192x192 and 512x512 using an online tool like:
   - https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image
   - Or use Photoshop/Figma

### 3. Test Your PWA

After installing the plugin and creating icons:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Then:

1. Open Chrome/Edge browser
2. Navigate to your preview URL (usually http://localhost:4173)
3. Look for the **install icon** in the address bar
4. Click "Install" to add BeatBloom to your home screen

## 📝 Notes

- The manifest will be auto-generated at build time
- Service worker is registered automatically
- Icons must exist before building
- PWA only works over HTTPS (except localhost)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**"Cannot find module 'vite-plugin-pwa'"**
→ Run `npm install -D vite-plugin-pwa`

**Icons not showing**
→ Make sure `/public/logo/icon-192.png` and `/public/logo/icon-512.png` exist

**App not installable**
→ Check browser console for manifest errors
→ Ensure you're using HTTPS (or localhost)

**That's it!** Your BeatBloom app is now a fully functional PWA! 🎉
